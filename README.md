# üåç https-request
This is a simple tool written in modern C++. It makes HTTP/S requests to a given host and prints the output.

- The goal of this project is to experiment with HTTP clients and OpenSSL. It is not a full-featured HTTP client. For a complete production-grade HTTP client library in C++, check out [express-client](https://github.com/shlomnissan/express-client).
- If you find this project informative or useful, please ‚≠êÔ∏è this repository to show your support.

## Features
- A command-line application
- Supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Written in modern C++
- Cross-platform

## HTTPS and certificate verification
Every operating system provides a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) that can be used to verify SSL certificates. However, there is no general way to import these lists.

Mozilla maintains its own trusted certificate authority (CA) store, which is frequently used by HTTP clients. [curl](https://curl.se/) has developed tools to extract these certificates from Firefox and convert them to a file containing the CAs' digital signatures suitable for certificate verification. This file can be downloaded directly from their servers at https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html.

The **https-request** executable requires a trusted CAs file named `ca-bundle.crt` to be placed in the same directory. This project includes a CMake option called `FETCH_TRUSTED_CA` (enabled by default) that downloads the Mozilla CA store into the build's binary directory. If you prefer to use a different store, turn off this option and place your own `ca-bundle.crt` file along with the **https-request** executable.

## Build
The steps below have been tested on Linux, MacOS, and Windows:

**1. Install dependencies**

Please make sure that the following dependencies are installed on your system:
- CMake (minimum version 3.22)
- OpenSSL

**2. Clone the repository**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/shlomnissan/https-request.git
```
**3. Generate build files for your environment**
```
$ cd https-request
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
To generate a build for the Release version, specify `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` instead.

**4. Build the tool**
```
cmake --build .
```
Alternatively, you can build the project using your default build system directly.

## Usage

This command-line application accepts a single argument: the hostname of the website to which you want to connect.
Only the HTTP and HTTPS URL schemes are supported.
```
$ https-request https://www.betamark.com 
```
