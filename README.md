# https-request
This is a simple command-line tool written in modern C++. It makes HTTP/S requests to a given host and prints the output.

- The goal of this project is to experiment with HTTP clients and OpenSSL. It is not a full-featured HTTP client. For a complete production-grade HTTP client library in C++, check out [express-client](https://github.com/shlomnissan/express-client).
